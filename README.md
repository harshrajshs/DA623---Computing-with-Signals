## Motivation

The rapid expansion of wireless communications has resulted in increased spectrum scarcity. Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) offer a promising solution by enabling dynamic spectrum access, allowing secondary users to opportunistically utilize underused frequency bands. Robust spectrum sensing, especially in OFDM-based systems, is crucial for this. I chose this topic to explore how unsupervised machine learning (clustering) can enhance spectrum sensing and contribute to more efficient wireless communication.

## Historical Perspective

Traditional spectrum sensing methods (energy detection, matched filtering, cyclostationary detection) have limitations, particularly under noise uncertainty and with unknown signals. Unsupervised learning, like clustering, is increasingly applied for adaptive, threshold-free signal detection, aligning with trends in  AI where data-driven approaches outperform hand-crafted methods.
